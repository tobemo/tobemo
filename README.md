### Hello there üëã
> Hi, I'm Tom√°s, an industrial engineer now specializing in deep learning on time series.

**I'm currently looking for a job in this field so feel free to contact me for any potential opportunities.**

You can take a look at this [written piece](tobemo.github.io) and my public repositories to get a better feel of who I am and what I can do for you.
Currently, there is not much going on here other than a simple demo I created, but over time I do plan to add more content.
Time permitting, I am hoping to be able to create atomic examples of all the things I have learned over the years (as detailed in the previously mentioned [written piece](tobemo.github.io)).
